%% GRIN ketamine
%{

we want to see if bursting changes with ketamine treatment, and if this
is specific to the ?reward sensitive? (RS) cells. Steve will be sending
us mouse IDs, session IDs and pics of his ROI, which I think we could
match up to our aligned stacks.

We could look for the bursting in the baseline periods of each trial.

We?d like to know a) if bursting is specific to RS cells; b) if this is
affected by introduction of shock trials; and c) if ketamine has an
effect on this.

For now, the data in the paper are from animals: 33 65 74 93. So we should
focus getting these formatted the same, and analyze these.

Yes, Chenyu, we need to get the Long sessions with injections aligned. We
will look at bursting before and after injections.
